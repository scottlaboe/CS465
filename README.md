# CS465

For this application I will be using a MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack to develop the Travlr Getaways web app. Mongo allows for databasing of different components needed to complete the business objectives such as containing different travel package information. Databasing travel packages simplifies maintenance by minimizing the complexity of logic. When additional travel packages need to be added or current packages modified, the principal logic implemented in Express, angular, and node will not require alteration to accommodate changes in package offerings. Instead, the app manager would only need to add or modify travel packages to the Mongo database. The interface to add or remove packages will be included in the administrator single-page application (SPA).\

Customers interact with the application through the angular front-end. Angular allows for a dynamic web page while maintaining a clean interface to the application and database tiers. A dynamic user interface is necessary to allow a powerful administrator SPA. By dynamically generating each web page and relegating as many elements as would be useful to the database, the SPA is able to control a lot of the major functionality for the app without having to recompile application and UI code.
